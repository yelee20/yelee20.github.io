## How to Drop a Foreign Key in MySQL


~~~sql
ALTER  TABLE  'table_name'  DROP  FOREIGN  KEY  'foreign_key'
~~~
and I got an error as below:
~~~sql
#1091  - Can't DROP 'foreign_key'; check that column/key exists
~~~

1. Find the foreign key contraint using 
	~~~sql
	SHOW  CREATE  TABLE  'table_name';
	~~~
	Normally it's 'table_name_ibfk_1'. <br>
2. Drop Foreign key
	~~~sql
	ALTER  TABLE  'table_name'  DROP  FOREIGN  KEY 'table_name_ibfk_1ï»¿';  
	ALTER  TABLE  'table_name'  DROP  INDEX  'column';
	~~~
