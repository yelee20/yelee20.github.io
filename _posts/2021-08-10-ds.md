## How to set a Career Path as a Data Science Student?

I switched my major to 'Data Systems and Engineering' after the first year. Now I am turning in year 3 in the upcoming semester. 

The point is, I have to set my path as a data science student. I am interested in both back-end development and data scientist. I've done a summer internship at [Vandalsoft](http://vandalsoft.com/) as a Back-end developer. It certainly helped me to learn new things and enhance my interest in software development.

Before learning coding in depth, I couldn't find any difference between data science and software development. Those looked pretty much the same to me. 

> 👩‍💻 What is Data Science? 👨‍💻

- Collect, **process**, analyze data and interpret the result
- Build a model and make a prediction/decision


> What skills do we need? 🧐
- Math/Statistics (highly important), Domain expertise,  Coding Skill
> 
> What is the difference between 
> **Data Scientist** VS **Data Analyst** VS **Data Engineer**?

1. Data Scientists
	- Develope, implement, and test hypotheses in order to devise and present data-led solutions for business challenges to key stakeholders.
	- Required Skills: strong technical and mathematical abilities such as machine learning, statistical modelling, and big data, and as well as advanced programming skills.
2. Data Analysts
	-   Gather, review, and analyze data to figure out **data-led insights** which guide and inform critical business decisions.
	-   Find/analyze interesting trends in the data.
	-   Create visualizations and dashboards to help the company interpret and make decisions with the data.
	- Required Skills: Communication skills, presentation skills, technical know-how, critical thinking and data visualisation skills.
3. Data Engineers
	- Construct/maintain **architectures** (like DB, large-scale processing systems)
	- Required Skills: statistical analysis and modelling, Data warehousing solutions and predictive modelling, machine learning, and data mining.
