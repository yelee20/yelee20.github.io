### 1. Why Github Pages?

So my question was 'What would be the best platform to start a tech blog?'

When deciding on a blogging platform, there are some set criteria it should meet.
Here are the top three requirements to look for when making my choice:

1. Future Career
    - Is it an international platform?
2. Customization
    - What customization does the platform support?
3. Pricing


I listed some platforms below:

- Medium
- Blogger
- Github Pages
- Naver Blog
- Tistory
- Velog.io


Based on the criteria, I decided to set up a blog with Github pages.
First of all, it's free and not limited to specific countries.
